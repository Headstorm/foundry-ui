<div align='center'>The only open-source UI library that's made to be remade</div>
## Intro

Foundry-UI (or Foundry for short) is a great choice for your next software project's __user interface (UI)__, because Foundry was created to:

* Support enterprise applications at any stage, from proof-of-concept to launch to enhancements
* Allow custom styling and behavior of indvidual components with Foundryâ€™s unique architecture
* Reach users on any device for any use case while maintaining full functionality and accessibilty

At of the time this writing, Foundry is new and launching with a fully supported React version. The Angular version is a work in progress, but don't let that stop you from reaching out about contributing on the Angular version.

Foundry is lovingly developed by Headstorm's Open Source group, but you can help out, too. Please reach out to us at __opensource@headstorm.com__ â€”we'd love to hear your feedback. Click on the "Start Here" link from the project you wish to work on for more details about getting started.

<!--Find the project board which you want to contribute to. Currently there are two project boards for each front-end library included in hs-ui:

- [rasa-react-ui project board](https://github.com/Headstorm/rasa-ui/projects/1)
- [rasa-angular-ui project board](https://github.com/Headstorm/rasa-ui/projects/2)

As well as a board for overarching issues that don't belong to either package.

- [rasa-ui project board](https://github.com/Headstorm/rasa-ui/projects/3)

Once you're on the board for your library of choice, pick a ticket from the `Priority to do` swim-lane. **Fork and clone** the repository and create a branch for your ticket, with the ticket number prefixing the name of the ticket (i.e. `4-publish-package-to-npm`). When making commits, be sure to prefix your commit messages with the ticket number, like so: `#4 Updating package.json to make the package public`. Once you've made a commit it should automatically be moved to the `In progress` swim-lane, and then moved to `Needs review` once a PR is made.-->
